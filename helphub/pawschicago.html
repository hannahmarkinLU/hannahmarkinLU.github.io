            <p>Helping homeless pets is just as rewarding for you as it is for them. Maybe more. For every walk, you get unbridled tail wags. For every clean bed, eyes filled with gratitude. For every meal, a happy head bump. Volunteer today and help us continue to save lives and expand services for these incredible animals. It takes a village to fulfill the mission of a No Kill Chicago. We couldn't do this without you.</p>

            <h3>
            Nan & Wayne Kocourek Medical Center</h2>
            <p>Give love and care to our newest arrivals: puppies and kittens, sick and injured pets, and spay/neuter patients. The PAWS Chicago Medical Center is the hub for our shelter medicine program and Lurie Clinic, providing volunteers with a wonderful opportunity to get hands-on with the care of animals and our operations. Whether you're interested in working directly with our animals or providing behind-the-scenes support, we need your help at the Medical Center.</p>
            <h3>
            Pippen Fasseas Adoption Center</h2>
            <p>Play with, socialize, train, and care for adoptable pets, and help them find their families. Our volunteers are indispensable in every aspect of our operation, from helping us open in the mornings to supporting our closing procedures at night. They work with our adopters, our visitors and, of course, our animals, giving them love, care, socialization and training. Our volunteers also help train and mentor other volunteers.</p>
            <h3>
            Off-Site</h2>
            <p>Support events, spread our message, and work directly in under-resourced communities. Since our founding Angels with Tails Adoption Event in 1998, we have recognized that real transformation happens for homeless animals when we reach people where they are. This means having events and outreach in high-traffic areas where we can engage people directly and raise awareness.</p>
